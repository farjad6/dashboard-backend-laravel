Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

empty databse and fresh migration and seed:
  php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
  
  php artisan make:model Invites -mcr

  php artisan make:resource InvitesResource --collection
  php artisan make:resource InvitesResource
  php artisan make:controller InvitesController
